The interactive sentiment analyzer App is a practical demonstration of applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews.

In this project, we leverage FastAPI, a user-friendly interface, and Hugging Face's Transformers library, which offers pre-trained NLP models.

The goal is to create an interactive tool that allows users to input text and receive instant classification about whether the sentiment expressed in the text is positive or negative.

Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and user sentiments in various domains, including the film industry.

By providing a user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis, this project showcases the potential for NLP applications and offers a practical solution for analyzing movie sentiments.
