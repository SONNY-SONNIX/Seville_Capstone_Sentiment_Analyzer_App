  ## Deploying an Interactive Sentiment Analyzer with Gradio and Transformers on Hugging Face
  
 ### Introduction
 
The Movie Sentiment Analysis App is a practical demonstration of applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews. 

In this project, we leverage Gradio, a user-friendly interface, and Hugging Face's Transformers library, which offers pre-trained NLP models.

The goal is to create an interactive tool that allows users to input movie reviews and receive instant predictions about whether the sentiment expressed in the review is positive, negative, or neutral.
