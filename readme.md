  ## Deploying an Interactive Sentiment Analyzer with Gradio and Transformers on Hugging Face
  
 ### Introduction
 
The Movie Sentiment Analysis App is a practical demonstration of applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of movie reviews. 

In this project, we leverage Gradio, a user-friendly interface, and Hugging Face's Transformers library, which offers pre-trained NLP models.

The goal is to create an interactive tool that allows users to input movie reviews and receive instant predictions about whether the sentiment expressed in the review is positive, negative, or neutral.

Sentiment analysis plays a pivotal role in understanding public opinion, customer feedback, and user sentiments in various domains, including the film industry.

By providing a user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis, this project showcases the potential for NLP applications and offers a 
practical solution for analyzing movie sentiments.

Welcome to Deploying an Interactive Sentiment Analyzer with Gradio and Transformers on Hugging Face! 

This project demonstrates how to build a movie sentiment analysis app using Gradio and Hugging Face's Transformers library. 

Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. 

It uses a previously pre-trained hugging text classification model(roBERTa-case).
The project showcases a simple sentiment analysis app for movie reviews.

### Dataset Overview 

The dataset used for this project contains movie reviews along with binary sentiment polarity labels. 

It serves as a benchmark for sentiment classification, with labels indicating whether the sentiment is positive or negative. 

Neutral sentiment is also considered as a class.

## Installation and Setup ⚙️🔧 

To get started, follow these installation steps:

# set up the environment on Windows by running the following code.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
  
  git clone <repository-url>

  - Navigate to the project directory.

  cd <project-directory>

- Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).

python -m venv myenv

- Activate the virtual environment.

### On Windows:

- myenv\Scripts\activate

  ### On macOS and Linux:

- source myenv/bin/activate

### Install the required packages.

- pip install -r requirements.txt

   ### The Two commands are of the same structure
